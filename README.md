## Introduction

#### Intro Project: Explore Weather Trends



The Exploring Weather Trends project will demonstrate using SQL and downloading data from a database. We will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where we live to overall global temperature trends.

#### Project 1: Investigating TMDB Movies Dataset

In this project, we will choose one of Udacity’s curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. We will complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.


```python
Image.open('p1.jpg')
```

#### Project 2: Analyze Experiment Results

In this project, we will be provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an landing page experiment. We’ll use statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report our conclusions and recommendations in a report.


```python
Image.open('p2.jpg')
```

#### Project 3: We Rate Dogs

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python, we’ll gather data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. We will document our wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.


```python
Image.open('p3.jpg')
```

#### Project 4: The Truth About Airline Statistics

This dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays, from 1987 to 2008. For our analysis, we are going to be using the three year period between 1989 to 1991 as our sample dataset as the whole dataset is too large to practically observe with Jupyter. Our goal is to ask as many questions as possible and visualise the data in univariate, bivariate and, multivariate.
